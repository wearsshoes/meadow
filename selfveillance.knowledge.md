# ReThread
A macOS menubar app that acts as an AI research assistant by analyzing your screen activity using Claude API.

## Project Mission
- Assist researchers by tracking and analyzing topic-relevant content
- Filter and analyze content based on configured research topics
- Generate detailed summaries of relevant research material
- Keep all data private and local

## Core Design Principles
- Skip automatic screenshots of ReThread's own interface
  - Check active window before taking screenshot
  
- UI Patterns
  - Auto-save changes immediately with visual feedback
  - Use browser-native UI components over OS-native when in web context
  - Keep menubar icon simple but informative (üì∏ idle, üëÅÔ∏è monitoring)
  - Show status in icon title, not menu

- Prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Use multiprocessing for clean process separation
