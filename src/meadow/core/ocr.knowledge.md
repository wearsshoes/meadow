# OCR Implementation Notes

## Performance Comparison

Initial testing between EasyOCR and macOS Vision framework:

### EasyOCR
- Requires ~2.3s initialization (one-time cost)
- First read: ~0.4s
- Subsequent reads: ~0.3s
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Requires loading ML model into memory

### Vision Framework
- No separate initialization
- First read: ~0.5s (includes framework initialization)
- Subsequent reads: ~0.15s (2x faster than EasyOCR)
- Native macOS only (11.0+)
- Lower memory footprint (uses system resources)

## Implementation Strategy
- Use Vision framework as primary OCR on macOS 11+
- Fall back to EasyOCR for:
  - Older macOS versions
  - Error cases
  - Cross-platform compatibility

## Testing Notes

### Simple Text Performance
- Both frameworks equally accurate on basic test cases
- Vision framework faster after initial run (~0.15s vs ~0.3s)

### Real-world Screenshot Results (Forum webpage)
- Vision framework:
  - Faster: 0.41s
  - Better formatting preservation
  - More accurate special characters (→, •)
  - Better handling of UI elements
  - Preserved timestamps accurately

- EasyOCR:
  - Slower: 3.42s
  - Some character confusion (e.g., '/' as 'f')
  - Inconsistent with special characters
  - More prone to spacing/formatting issues

### Areas for Further Testing
  - Real-world screenshots
  - Different fonts and sizes
  - Multiple languages
  - Special characters
  - Various background colors
